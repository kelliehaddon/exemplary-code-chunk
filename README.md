# Exemplary Code Chunk
This [code chunk](exemplary-code-chunk.pdf) is part of an assignment in my data analysis class (SIS 750) at the School of International Service at American University. The assignment was to replicate and then improve on Figure 2 from a paper by [Keele et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055421000034) using their [data](la_turnout_basic.dta). In this paper, Keele et al. (2021) evaluate the impact of efforts to disenfranchise African American voters in Louisiana in the 1950s and 1960s. They focus specifically on the Understanding Clause, which some parishes administered and others did not.
